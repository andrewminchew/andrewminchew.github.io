<h1>Just an update</h1>

<p>I started to write about everything I want my website to be, but I think it's probably better to just start doing it...</p>

<p>This is a cool site and I subscribed to the newsletter. Looking forward to the first article. <a href="https://www.htmlhobbyist.com/">The HTML Hobbyist</a></p>

<h2>3am</h2>

<p>Three chirp A chirp M <br />
New chirp battery chirp please <br />
"Smart" smoke detector  </p>

<p>I wrote this haiku last night after while trying to go to sleep after changing the batteries on my Nest thermostat.</p>

<h2>Mosquito Bucket of Death</h2>

<p>Thinking this would be the perfect time to get a few of these going in the backyard so that by the time it's actually cool enough to hang out outside again, our mosquito population will be theoretically reduced. At the very least, it's something to do with all the kitty litter buckets I can't bear to throw away. <a href="https://www.energyvanguard.com/blog/try-the-mosquito-bucket-of-death/">Try the Mosquito Bucket of Death - Energy Vanguard</a></p>

<h2>A list of all the things I do want my website to be:</h2>

<ul>
<li>share projects digital and physical  </li>
<li>Writings, musings, etc  </li>
<li>Stuff I find online  </li>
<li>Occasional photo dumps  </li>
<li>Seek log   </li>
<li>Parenting tactics  </li>
<li>Productivity  </li>
<li>Life hacks  </li>
<li>DIY  </li>
<li>Pets  </li>
<li>Books, shows, games  </li>
<li>"It's A way for me to look in the mirror"  </li>
<li>Hopefully a connection to kindred spirits online  </li>
<li>Something like a memoir  </li>
<li>"Musings and ephemera"  </li>
<li>“Random desk comments, break room banter”  </li>
<li>a place to play with code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things I <strong>don't</strong> want my website to be</h2>

<ul>
<li>Portfolio  </li>
<li>"Hire me"  </li>
<li>Social media  </li>
<li>Deepest thoughts  </li>
<li>Focused  </li>
<li>Religion  </li>
<li>Politics  </li>
<li>Thoughtfully optimized  </li>
<li>Tracked or analyzed, because knowing how many people viewed is not the point, the point is me knowing that it’s there.  </li>
</ul>

<p>But who am I kidding, all those don't's are probably a projection of all the things I'm inclined to write about or do, but find disagreeable on some level.</p>

<h2>"AI is there any news I should know about?"</h2>

<p>I have started using a prompt like this in Perplexity every few days and the results have been to my satisfaction. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm trying to curb my tendency to compulsively check political / world news, get anxious about the things I read, and spin out fretting about the state of the world. Lately I have been doing pretty good at only reading hacker news and the verge, and I feel like the things I find on these sites typically don't send me doomscrolling, but I still want to get some sense of "what's going on out there". Can you give me a brief (just a few sentences) of the "state of the world" to help me feel like I'm not completely out of touch, but also avoid spinning out over news that I ultimately have no control over?</p>
