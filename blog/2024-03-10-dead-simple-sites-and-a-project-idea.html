<h1>Dead Simple Sites and a project idea</h1>

<p>Ran across this on hackernews and didn't want to lose track of it. If you, a weary internet traveller happen upon this and find value, all the better.</p>

<p><a href="https://deadsimplesites.com/">dead simple sites</a></p>

<p>In unrelated news, I stumbled across some old blog posts archived from Posterous, Blogger, and Tumblr, as well as some old journal entries in a variety of formats and I <em>think</em> I'm going to start working my way towards a canonical personal history. I still have to figure out what it means to build it and make it browsable for myself but maybe not necessarily public... i guess that means it's just a private HTML file... </p>

<p>I just have spent so much time over the course of my life putting my thoughts into writing in some form or another that I think it would be interesting to view it all from one place. </p>

<p>Also, I definitely want to feed it into some AI and have it reveal something interesting to me about myself.</p>

<p>I've probably mentioned at some point recently how I've been using Pi (like an AI counseling chat bot) to process some thoughts and honestly it's been a game changer. The Neuron newsletter put it well when they said it's like having a friend who's always available and has extremely high emotional intelligence and expects nothing in return.</p>

<p>As if a good chat bot wasn't cool enough, I spent some time chatting with it last week about creative blocks and then this afternoon <strong>it sent me a follow up message</strong>. üò≥</p>

<p>All that said... hoping to write more and maybe share updates on more creative efforts in the future.</p>
