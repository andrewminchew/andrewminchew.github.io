<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I hope I'll make more use of this website than others I've started in the past. I'm hoping that because I am directly editing the code I'm more likely to stay interested for longer.</p>
<p>I just have in mind that this might be a central spot to put tinker project that I make, stuff I craft by hand, pixel art, sketches, etc.</p>
<p>Just bear with me. Or don't. I won't hold it against you!</p>

  <p>Since my last update I've discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">freecodecamp.com</a> and started working through lessons there. Very cool resource that I hope to continue learning from in the future. Probably the first javascript course I've taken that I walked away from feeling like I could actually put a project together. Time to put the rubber to the road I suppose. I saw a suggestion that a JavaScript clock is a good beginner project to undertake. I've also had in mind a kind of tracker / log application that would serve as a tracker for a simplified version of Dungeons and Dragons that I've been toying at with my boys.</p>
