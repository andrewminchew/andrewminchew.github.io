<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I hope I'll make more use of this website than others I've started in the past. I'm hoping that because I am directly editing the code I'm more likely to stay interested for longer.</p>
<p>I just have in mind that this might be a central spot to put tinker project that I make, stuff I craft by hand, pixel art, sketches, etc.</p>
<p>Just bear with me. Or don't. I won't hold it against you!</p>
  <h2>Reminder to me <span style="font-color:gray;font-size:smaller;font-weight:200;"><i>2020-08-16 20:41</i></span></h2>
  <p>Sometimes I forget that it's OK that I have opinions and it's OK for me to share them. And it's OK for me to share the things I create, just because I want to put them out there somewhere. A while back, I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@andrewminchew/why-i-dont-write-ebffcbb479e9">a few hundred words on Medium about why I don't really write much</a>. Re-reading that now, (nearly seven years later... facepalm), I realize that I still operate in a very similar way. I draw things, photograph them for posterity, then don't share it. I have thoughts, jot them down, and don't share it. I have ideas, and don't pursue them. Posting this hoping that it might generate some forward motion in my own personal development.</p>
  <p>With that in mind, here's a drawing of my living room (felt tip on copy paper).</p>

  <p>Since my last update I've discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">freecodecamp.com</a> and started working through lessons there. Very cool resource that I hope to continue learning from in the future. Probably the first javascript course I've taken that I walked away from feeling like I could actually put a project together. Time to put the rubber to the road I suppose. I saw a suggestion that a JavaScript clock is a good beginner project to undertake. I've also had in mind a kind of tracker / log application that would serve as a tracker for a simplified version of Dungeons and Dragons that I've been toying at with my boys.</p>
